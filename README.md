# wu-dp1

This repo stores all the files used in our first course Data Processing 1 from the Data Science specialization at the WU Vienna. Most of them are for the group assignments 2 and 5. However, I will also upload the other assignments if it is allowed. The work is done by using the Python language and the assignments are uploaded as Jupyter Notebooks.
